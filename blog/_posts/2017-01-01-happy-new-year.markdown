**Open GApps wishes all of you a Happy New Year and the best for 2017!**

Looking back at 2016, the year brought us a lot of new things, e.g. Nougat (both *7.0* and *7.1*) but also our very own [Open GApps App](https://opengapps.org/app/)!

With already more than 100k downloads in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.opengapps.app&hl=en&referrer=utm_source%3Dopengapps%26utm_medium%3Dblognewyear) and many more by directly downloading the APK from our own website, as being mentioned as a must-have app of 2016 by [Android Police](https://www.androidpolice.com/2016/12/15/most-wanted-android-polices-top-five-apps-of-2016/) uptake of the 1.0.x version goes fast. Meanwhile the developers are now preparing for the upcoming 1.1 release.

One of the great things of working on Open GApps is the community. We want to thank all the people from the community that already helped to [translate the app](https://github.com/opengapps/opengapps-app-support) to various languages. If your language is not there yet, please donâ€™t hesitate to contribute yours! Also we want to thank all the people that have [donated](https://opengapps.org/donate/) and make the development of the Open GApps packages possible.

At the moment we are preparing the last translations for 1.1 of the app and fixing some last known bugs. After that we will get to the alpha-testing phase with the team and hopefully to beta-testing later this month.
