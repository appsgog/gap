* **If I have a problem with flashing the Open GApps package, where can I get help?**

   Check the [OpenGApps.org support page](#https://opengapps.org/#supportsection) for help with the packages and installation.

* **Why does flashing Open GApps result in losing the permissions granted to the app?**

   The first time you flash Open GApps on a system that has no GApps yet, it needs to reset all system permissions. That means all current permissions are lost, also for this app.

* **Why is there an advertisement in the app when I download a package?**

   The Open GApps project is supported through [donations](#https://opengapps.org/donate) and advertisements. The app shows only a pre-loaded advertisement *after* starting the download, it does not block or slow the download process. We will never impair functionality and thank you for supporting the project!

* **Can I help to translate and localize the application?**

   Yes you can! Go [here](https://github.com/opengapps/opengapps-app-support) for the files with translatable strings. You can use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) or any text editor to create your translations. Open a GitHub [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) with your updated files when you are done!

* **I think I found a bug in the app, how can I report it?**

   We are always interested in feedback! Report your bug [here](https://github.com/opengapps/opengapps-app-support/issues). **Please take notice not to report any bugs with the Open GApps package through this bugtracker**.
